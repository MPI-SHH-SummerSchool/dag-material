## MPI-SHH Summer School: Doorway to Human History<br/> Phylogenetics Workshop<br/> 19 Aug. 2021

### Megan Michel<br/> (megan_michel@eva.mpg.de, @megan_michel on Mattermost)

Together we will work through some exercises to gain familiarity with phylogenetic methods used in analyses of ancient pathogen single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data. We will be analyzing a dataset of genome-wide SNP data from ancient and modern *Yersinia pestis*, the causative agent of the plague. We will start in breakout rooms and come together at the end of the session to discuss our findings.

## Part 1: Preparation
### Readings
To get a preview of topics discussed in the Phylogenetics Workshop, check out the following readings: 
1. Spyrou, M. A., Bos, K. I., Herbig, A. & Krause, J. Ancient pathogen genomics as an emerging tool for infectious disease research. Nat. Rev. Genet. 20, 323â€“340 (2019).- https://rdcu.be/cucFc

Review summarizing methods commonly employed in genomic studies of ancient pathogens. Summarizes methods and case-studies that will be examined in more detail during the workshop.

**Note:** Readings should be accessible through links provided above. If you have trouble accessing articles, please contact me via email (megan_michel@eva.mpg.de) or on via PM on Mattermost.

### Software and Data Downloads
